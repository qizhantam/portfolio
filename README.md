## 2018
### Signal Temporal Logic (STL) meets Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJ-Reachability): Connections and Applications (WAFR 2018)
The goal of this project is to merge STL with HJ-Reachability such that time-varying objectives of a robot can be achieved while guaranteeing safety. I worked on this project during my independent study in the [Stanford Autonomous Systems Laboratory](http://asl.stanford.edu/). You can find the details in the [paper](http://asl.stanford.edu/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Chen.Tam.Livingston.Pavone.WAFR18.pdf) which was recently accepted to the 2018 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics. Videos of the experiments can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI4bbBVkcgs&t=2s), and the code found [here](https://github.com/StanfordASL/stlhj).
