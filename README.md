## 2018
### Signal Temporal Logic meets Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability: Connections and Applications (WAFR 2018, co-first author)
The goal of this project is to merge STL with HJ-Reachability such that time-varying objectives of a robot can be achieved while guaranteeing safety. I worked on this project during my Master's degree in the [Stanford Autonomous Systems Laboratory](http://asl.stanford.edu/). You can find the details in the [paper](http://asl.stanford.edu/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Chen.Tam.Livingston.Pavone.WAFR18.pdf) which was recently accepted to the 2018 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics. You can also watch the [experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI4bbBVkcgs&t=2s) or dive into the deep end with the [code](https://github.com/StanfordASL/stlhj).

### Drift Initiation via Nonlinear Trajectory Optimization
For the AA203: Intro to Optimal Controls course, [John](https://github.com/JohnHaTrick) and I applied non-linear optimization techniques for state and control trajectories to initiate the Scandanavian Flick maneuver. We used the bicycle model for the car dynamics and a logit approximation of the piecewise Fiala brush tire model. Skip to the [results](https://youtu.be/JB334BDw6gY), study the [paper](https://github.com/qizhantam/portfolio/raw/master/docs/papers/Alsterda_Tam.pdf) for all the details, or read the [code](https://github.com/JohnHaTrick/AA203).

### Autonomous Search and Rescue 
Building upon the [asl_turtlebot](https://github.com/StanfordASL/asl_turtlebot) ROS package, my team developed and implemented a [software stack](https://github.com/qizhantam/asl_turtlebot/tree/project) of integrated perception and navigation algorithms such as SLAM, TensorFlow and A* on a Turtlebot3 Burger that came with a VLP-16 Velodyne LiDAR puck and a camera to [locate animals in a model city and rescue them](https://youtu.be/3CHbzuHkM34).

### Mechatronics: Autonomous Line-Following Robot 
Designed and built a robot from the ground-up to accomplish tasks such as navigation by [following lines and depositing balls in designated bins](https://youtu.be/KClaUtPyq60). Hardware components include IR-LEDs, phototransistors, DC brush motors, stepper motors, all controlled by a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller with a [state-space algorithm and feedback controller](https://github.com/srharris91/ME210_CowShots).

### Herding Animals through Social Integration of Robots and Leader-Follower Formation Control
I leveraged upon the flocking instinct of herd animals in a [study](https://github.com/qizhantam/portfolio/raw/master/docs/papers/AA277_FinalPaper_QizhanTam.pdf) to develop control methods for robots to herd animals using path-following and potential field navigation techniques.

## 2017
### Grid Stability Management and Price Arbitrage for Distributed Energy Storage and Generation via Reinforcement Learning
I developed and implemented a reinforcement learning control policy for distributed batteries in a simulated residential environment using the IEEE 123 feeder model supplied with real user load and modeled solar generation. This was a course project for CS238: Decision Making under Uncertainty. The paper and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/qizhantam/CS238_GridStability_ReinforcementLearning).

### Density Functional Theory Computations for Li-ion Battery Materials (Teaching Material)
I developed this project for the students of ME420. It involved the quantum mechanical calculations of Lithium Cobalt Oxide crystal structures to predict the voltage and volume changes of the crystals during charge cycling. All computations were done using [QuantumEspresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) on Stanford's High Performance Computing Cluster. Course material can be found [here](https://github.com/qizhantam/ME420_DensityFunctionalTheory_LiBattery). The closing project discussion slides and the solutions to the assignments are made available upon request.  
2018 Update: Modified for Slurm job scheduler (previously PBS).

## 2016-older
I'm in the process of consolidating my 2016 and older projects onto this page. You can check out those projects [here](https://tamqizhan.wixsite.com/portfolio/).
