### Signal Temporal Logic (STL) meets Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJ-Reachability): Connections and Applications
Goal: Merge STL with HJ-Reachability such that time-varying objectives of a robot can be achieved while guaranteeing safety.  
This research project was done while I was doing my independent study in Stanford Autonomous Systems Laboratory, @StanfordASL.
